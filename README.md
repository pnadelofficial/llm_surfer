# llm_surfer
The LLM Surfer is a brief Python module that helps researchers scrape data from the web and filter based on the research goal. The user should supply an unquantized local autoregressive language model, as you would be able to find on HuggingFace (I have tested this most with Llama-3-70B), a research goal, and a specific query. Currently supported search engines are as follows: 
* Congress.gov
* DuckDuckGo
* OpenAlex

The examples in this repo come from the work that I began with the Climate Policy Lab at the Fletcher School. That said, the utility of the concepts expounded in the LLM Surfer are applicable to many other fields, especially in the humanities and the social sciences.

The LLM Surfer was presented in a short paper published and presented as a part of PEARC 2024: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626203.3670577. 

This work is very priliminary! I will be updating this repo with changes as they arise. If you would like to contribute, I would be happy to look over any pull requests or discuss the nature of your changes at length.
