    "The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive inventory of federal climate adaptation policies in the United States. We define climate adaptation policies as policies that support “adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts.”\n",
    " \n",
    "### Grounds for inclusion:\n",
    "* Action constitutes a policy instrument (can include plans or strategies). Policy instruments, or tools, are “the techniques through which governments generate, evaluate, and implement policy options” (Kapano and Howlett, 2020)\n",
    "* Action constitutes adaptation based on the three categories listed below\n",
    "* We include policies that would not be implemented for any other reason than to adapt to climate change (we call these policies “Explicit Adaptation Policies”). An example of an Explicit Adaptation policy is a National Adaptation Strategy designed to respond to climate change.\n",
    "* We also include policies that would not be implemented for any other reason other than to address climate-related hazards (such as flood, heat, or drought), but do not directly mention climate change or adaptation (we call these “Explicit Hazard Policies”). For example, though a policy on decreasing flood risk may not mention climate change, it still increases resilience to a climate hazard (flooding) so would be included.\n",
    "* We also include policies that may be implemented for multiple reasons not exclusive to climate adaptation, but that have an impact on climate resilience (we call these “Implicit Policies”). An example of this is a social services policy like funding affordable housing after a disaster.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Grounds for exclusion:\n",
    "* Policies focused exclusively on climate change mitigation \n",
    "* Aspirational policy statements with no clear policy instrument\n",
    "* Non-adaptation risk reduction:\n",
    "    - Environmental or disaster preparedness policies that did not significantly relate to the effects of climate change were excluded. This includes environmental management of toxics and earthquake policies for example. \n",
    "    - Actions taking place solely at the local or state government level, with no federal involvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hazard Classification:\n",
    "After you have decided the relevancy of each document, classify it according to the following hazard types:\n",
    "* Explicit Adaptation: Policies with a primary stated goal to adapt to climate change.\n",
    "* Explicit Hazard: Policies that address climate-related hazards (such as flood, heat, or drought), but do not directly mention climate change or adaptation.\n",
    "* Implicit: Policies that do not have a stated goal to address climate-related hazards or adaptation, but that have an impact on climate resilience.\n",

    "The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive inventory of federal climate adaptation policies in the United States. We define climate adaptation policies as policies that support “adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts.”\n",
    " \n",
    "### Grounds for inclusion:\n",
    "* Action constitutes a policy instrument (can include plans or strategies). Policy instruments, or tools, are “the techniques through which governments generate, evaluate, and implement policy options” (Kapano and Howlett, 2020)\n",
    "* Action constitutes adaptation based on the three categories listed below\n",
    "* We include policies that would not be implemented for any other reason than to adapt to climate change (we call these policies “Explicit Adaptation Policies”). An example of an Explicit Adaptation policy is a National Adaptation Strategy designed to respond to climate change.\n",
    "* We also include policies that would not be implemented for any other reason other than to address climate-related hazards (such as flood, heat, or drought), but do not directly mention climate change or adaptation (we call these “Explicit Hazard Policies”). For example, though a policy on decreasing flood risk may not mention climate change, it still increases resilience to a climate hazard (flooding) so would be included.\n",
    "* We also include policies that may be implemented for multiple reasons not exclusive to climate adaptation, but that have an impact on climate resilience (we call these “Implicit Policies”). An example of this is a social services policy like funding affordable housing after a disaster.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Grounds for exclusion:\n",
    "* Policies focused exclusively on climate change mitigation \n",
    "* Aspirational policy statements with no clear policy instrument\n",
    "* Non-adaptation risk reduction:\n",
    "    - Environmental or disaster preparedness policies that did not significantly relate to the effects of climate change were excluded. This includes environmental management of toxics and earthquake policies for example. \n",
    "    - Actions taking place solely at the local or state government level, with no federal involvement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hazard Classification:\n",
    "After you have decided the relevancy of each document, classify it according to the following hazard types:\n",
    "* Explicit Adaptation: Policies with a primary stated goal to adapt to climate change.\n",
    "* Explicit Hazard: Policies that address climate-related hazards (such as flood, heat, or drought), but do not directly mention climate change or adaptation.\n",

    "* Development: Includes international cooperation, development aid, sustainable development, and rural development. - local development included.\n",
    "* National Security: Military response to instability/volatility associated with climate change. May include responses to population displacement, disease transmission, Arctic sovereignty, or resource conflict. \n",
    "* Forestry: Forest ecosystem health; forest ecosystems used in economic activities. Includes game management and community forests. \n",
    "* Fisheries: Marine/riparian ecosystem health; marine/riparian ecosystems used in economic activities. \n",
    "* Transportation: Includes road/highway maintenance, public transportation, air traffic, railroad systems, shipping. Insurance Private sector. \n",
    "* Tourism: Private sector. Includes recreation. \n",
    "* Economy: Costs associated with climate change. Includes finance, employment, labour, trade, treasury, industry, and livelihoods. \n",

    "The purpose of this project is to study what governments (local, state, and national) are doing to prepare for extreme heat events. In many places across the world, extreme heat is a growing public health threat. We’re interested in studying extreme heat policies anywhere that they have been enacted. The goal of this phase of research is to compile an inventory of academic articles that analyze the functionality of extreme heat policies. We will use this to evaluate the effectiveness of different extreme heat policies in practice. By policy in practice, we mean public policies that have been implemented and studied, not just suggested, or modelled. \n",
